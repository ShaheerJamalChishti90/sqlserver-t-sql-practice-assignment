Exercise 8: Compute Deltas Between Consecutive Orders

Exercise:
In this exercise, we're going to compute the difference between two consecutive orders from the same customer.

Show the ID of the order (order_id), the ID of the customer (customer_id), the total_amount of the order, the total_amount of the previous order based on the order_date (name the column previous_value), and the difference between the total_amount of the current order and the previous order (name the column delta).
